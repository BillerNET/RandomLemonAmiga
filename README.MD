# Random LemonAmiga.com game page

This is a chrome extension that places a button in the menu. Clicking the button will send the user to a random game on the site.

It will also change how images are scaled so when the 2x viewer is open it will look more crisp.

This extension is not endorsed by LemonAmiga.com.

There are certain actions you can complete on the site which fail to trigger the button to appear. Such as changing the landscape. A refresh will fix that.

Version 2 adds support for Lemon64.com
